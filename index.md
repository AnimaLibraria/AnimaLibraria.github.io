# Hermione Granger  
Hermione Granger is my favourite character from the Harry-Potter-Series. She's booksmart and clever, but can also be streetsmart when needed (remember that scene were she hit Draco Malfoy after he used some slurs?). She likes to follow rules ("We could be dead, or worse, expelled!"). Hermione is the daughter of dentists, so not born into a wizard family, but adapts greatly to her new sourroundings at Hogwarts. She is a very, very good witch. Her patronus is an otter.
